A large scale event such as a music concert has its own
complexities. Ticket booking, artist's time slot, attendee
engagement are some of the complexities. A simplified
system is thus required in order to keep track of the above
activities.
A ticket booking system is implemented using java swing as
the front end providing the GUI.The users can choose the
date and time slot for the event they wish to attend.
 The users get re-directed to another page that provides the
details regarding the type of ticket(VIP,Phase-II,Phase-I),
discounts and food coupons.
Using Facade as the design pattern(second tier),
complexities of such a system can be hidden and an
interface to the client is provided. Now the client can access
the system with ease. Client/Attendee needs a simplified
interface to the overall functionality of a concert.
The back-end is implemented with the help of Java JDBC .
JDBC is a java API which is used to connect and execute
queries with the database of the concert.Here the details of
the customers are stored and retrieved as and when
required.
The final ticket price is calculated and an online e-ticket is
generated providing details about the customer and the
artist's concert they wish to attend.
